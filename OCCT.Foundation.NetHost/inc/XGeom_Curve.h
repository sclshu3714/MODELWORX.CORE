//class Geom_Curve;
//DEFINE_STANDARD_HANDLE(Geom_Curve, Geom_Geometry)

//! The abstract class Curve describes the common
//! behavior of curves in 3D space. The Geom package
//! provides numerous concrete classes of derived
//! curves, including lines, circles, conics, Bezier or
//! BSpline curves, etc.
//! The main characteristic of these curves is that they
//! are parameterized. The Geom_Curve class shows:
//! - how to work with the parametric equation of a curve
//! in order to calculate the point of parameter u,
//! together with the vector tangent and the derivative
//! vectors of order 2, 3,..., N at this point;
//! - how to obtain general information about the curve
//! (for example, level of continuity, closed
//! characteristics, periodicity, bounds of the parameter field);
//! - how the parameter changes when a geometric
//! transformation is applied to the curve or when the
//! orientation of the curve is inverted.
//! All curves must have a geometric continuity: a curve is
//! at least "C0". Generally, this property is checked at
//! the time of construction or when the curve is edited.
//! Where this is not the case, the documentation states so explicitly.
//! Warning
//! The Geom package does not prevent the
//! construction of curves with null length or curves which
//! self-intersect.

		//! from package gp, T is the period and must be a constant.
		//! There are three possibilities :
		//! . the curve is never periodic by definition (SegmentLine)
		//! . the curve is always periodic by definition (Circle)
		//! . the curve can be defined as periodic (BSpline). In this case
		//! a function SetPeriodic allows you to give the shape of the
		//! curve.  The general rule for this case is : if a curve can be
